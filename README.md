Apple Watch utility to determine when the next bus times at selected bus stops.

# About

Using an unofficial API from the Metlink service, this app provides an Apple Watch app (not provided by MetLink) for tracking bus times. This current implementation is customized for my use, but I plan to add addtional functionality to be able to add your own bus stops.
